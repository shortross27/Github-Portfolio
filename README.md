## About
Hi, I’m Tyler Ross — a versatile data analyst passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights that drive growth. With hands-on experience in data collection, transformation, and analysis, I’ve developed a proficiency in SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python, which I use to support data-driven decision-making.

My background spans leadership, logistics, and technical fields, giving me a unique perspective on problem-solving and analytical thinking. As I work toward my Bachelor’s in Data Science at the University of Maryland Global Campus, I’m focused on building a portfolio that showcases my skills in data visualization, predictive modeling, and business analysis.

In this portfolio, you’ll find projects demonstrating the entire data analysis process, from data cleaning and wrangling to visual storytelling and actionable recommendations. Each project reflects my dedication to delivering measurable results, particularly for organizations with a growth-focused mindset.

## Key Skills
- Data Analysis & Visualization: Proficient in Tableau, Power BI, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), and SQL (MySQL, Postgres, Oracle).
- Business & Technical Skills: Strong foundation in communication, leadership, and problem-solving developed through years in supervisory and technical roles.
- Education: Currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Data Science, with coursework in SQL, database management, statistics, and calculus. Completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate, covering the end-to-end data analysis process.

I’m always excited to connect with fellow data enthusiasts, collaborators, and potential employers. Thanks for visiting my portfolio, and feel free to reach out if you’d like to chat about data or explore potential collaborations!

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Exploartory Data Analysis of NYC Taxi and Limo Data
**Code:** Link Here<br />
**Summary:** The 2017 Yellow Taxi Trip dataset on Kaggle contains detailed trip records for New York City’s yellow taxi services, capturing information like pickup and drop-off dates, locations, passenger count, trip distance, fare, and payment type. It’s ideal for analyzing trip patterns, demand trends, fare structures, and geographic insights across NYC. This dataset is large, offering data across the entire year, making it suitable for time-series analysis, geographic clustering, and predictive modeling.<br />
**Skills:** Data cleaning, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data vizualization, python proficiency, analytical thinkning.<br />
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Datetime, and Seaborn.<br />
**Results:** Review of the 2017 yellow taxi trip data in New York City showed an average ride cost of around $13.68, with a trend towards slightly higher fares compared to previous years when adjusted for inflation, indicating a potential increase in tipping frequency or amounts as a contributing factor to the price rise. Identified outliers within trip distance and total cost, which plays an important role in considering future projections.
